## What is the ESNcard?

The ESNcard is the **membership card** of the **Erasmus Student Network (ESN)**. It gives you access to all the services offered by ESN and all our partners. The aim of the ESNcard &mdash;or ESN membership&mdash; is to support international students and trainees and give them access to affordable opportunities during their period abroad.

With the ESNcard, you will enjoy plenty of discounts -housing, sport, food, bars, etc.- all over Europe. You will also have the opportunity to participate in hundreds of events with your ESN section and other sections around your destination country, and even beyond, for the period of your membership.

## Why should I get one?

Your ESNcard gives you **access to all ESN activities and hundreds of discounts all around Madrid, Spain and Europe**. You can check our [international](https://www.esnupm.org/descuentosinternacionales) and [national](https://www.esnupm.org/descuentosnacionales) partners and discounts as well as the special [partners and discounts available here in Madrid](https://sites.google.com/view/esncard-madrid/).

Additionally, in order to be able to provide you with the best activities all year round we encourage international students to join us and make their time to the fullest. That is why **for most trips and activities** where we partner with other institutions, sections and locations, **we require you to have the ESNcard**. This ensures you will enjoy amazing experiences.

## Can I get the ESNcard even if I don't come from an Erasmus+ programme?

**Yes, of course!** The ESNcard is **open to all international students** regardless of their studying curriculum or programme or where they come from. It is also open to local students collaborating with us to provide amazing activities for all!!

## How much does it cost?

**It only costs 10 euros!** This makes it valid for a whole year, more than enough for you to have lots of good times!

{{< notice note >}}
> **Update on payment methods**

Due to the current situation at our office, **we only accept payments on-site when you come to pickup your ESNcard**. At the office you can pay with cash or through the Verse app &mdash;our preferred method&mdash;.

We can also accept payments by bank transfer but have in mind it takes 1-2 business days for the payment to arrive. Make sure that we are able to verify your payment when you come to pick up your card.

## Other important information

### What is Verse?

Verse is the official payments app and processor of ESN. All ESN networks across Spain and Europe use it. It is extremely easy to use and it works as a digital coin purse which you can top-up with any credit or debit card of any country. Payments are instant and you can just pay with a tap, this is very useful for us when managing payments in activities and events. More info about Verse can be found [here](https://verse.me/en/faq/).

{{<notice tip>}}
> **You can get free 5‚Ç¨ if you don't have Verse yet!**

If you don't have Verse already we can help you to set it up when you come to pick up your ESNcard. **If you set it up with us we will give you a 5 euro Verse voucher** for you to spend through Verse any way you like (maybe pay other activities or to get your card at half the price).

You should strongly consider using Verse as it is easier to pay with it.
